# Install Release (Go Version)

> Note: This is a work in progress. and currently generated by Cursor AI.

This is a Go implementation of the [install-release](https://github.com/Rishang/install-release) CLI tool. It provides the same functionality as the Python version but is written in Go for better performance and easier distribution.

## Features

- Install single-binary executables from GitHub/GitLab releases
- Automatic system detection (OS and architecture)
- Smart asset selection based on system compatibility
- State management for installed tools
- Update management for installed tools
- Configuration management
- Support for GitHub and GitLab repositories

## Building

```bash
# Build the binary
go build -o ir .

# Or build for specific platforms
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ir-linux-amd64 .
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ir-darwin-amd64 .
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ir-windows-amd64.exe .
```

## Installation

After building, you can install the binary to your system:

```bash
# Copy to a directory in your PATH
sudo cp ir /usr/local/bin/

# Or install to your home directory
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp ir ~/bin/
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

The Go version provides the same CLI interface as the Python version:

```bash
# Install a tool
ir get https://github.com/denoland/deno

# List installed tools
ir ls

# Update all tools
ir upgrade

# Remove a tool
ir rm deno

# Configure the tool
ir config --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

# Show state
ir state

# Hold/unhold updates for a tool
ir hold deno
ir hold deno --unset
```

## Configuration

The tool stores configuration in:
- Linux: `~/.config/install_release/config.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/.config/install_release/config.json`

Configuration options:
- `token`: GitHub API token
- `gitlab_token`: GitLab API token
- `path`: Installation path (defaults to `~/bin`)
- `pre_release`: Include pre-releases in updates

## State Management

The tool stores state information about installed tools in:
- Linux: `~/.config/install_release/state.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/.config/install_release/state.json`

## Differences from Python Version

- Written in Go for better performance
- Single binary distribution
- No external dependencies (except standard library)
- Simplified error handling
- More efficient memory usage

### Adding New Features

1. Add new data structures to `types.go`
2. Implement core logic in appropriate files
3. Add CLI commands to `commands.go`
4. Update tests if applicable

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...
```
